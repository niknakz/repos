# Tutorial

Let's get **up and running in less than 5 minutes**.

:::warning

this is still in the very early stages, proceed with caution

:::

## Getting Started

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Create your local build

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

clone or [fork](https://github.com/niknakz/repos/fork) this repository

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ssh-clone" label="Clone SSH" default>

    git clone git clone git@github.com:niknakz/repos.git

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="http-clone" label="Clone HTTP">

    git clone https://github.com/niknakz/inhouse-scrims.git

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

install dependencies and start a local dev server

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

open the `repos.config.ts` file

uncomment the code in the return

once this file is populated the app will skip the demo screen and open straight to the dashboard

more docs on this soon but for now the syntax is documented with typescript in that file

once you have everything set up build and serve for best performance and to enable to local search

```bash
npm run clear
npm run build
npm run serve
```

reference the [docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/) to customize your local instance üëç
